Coordinate System
=================

When drawing shapes to the screen the programmer
must tell the computer where to draw the specific shape.
For this there exists an agreement how this shall be done.
This agreement is called coordinate system.

Point on the screen consists of two numbers and is marked `(x, y)`.
This means that the point is `x` units to right from the left side of the canvas
and `y` units down from the top.

In EppaBasic origo (point `(0, 0)`) is located in the left top corner of the screen.
This is a common practice in many programming languages.
Note that this differs from the typical coordinate system used
on many math courses where the origo is located at the bottom left corner.
